## ❌ Test Cards DON'T Work

**Why test cards fail:**

- They check if card is valid, has funds, and is active
- Test cards are rejected immediately
- Using fake cards can get your account banned

**Common test cards (won't work):**
- `4111 1111 1111 1111` (Visa test)
- `5555 5555 5555 4444` (Mastercard test)
- `3782 822463 10005` (Amex test)

**These are for payment gateway testing only, NOT for real signups.**
